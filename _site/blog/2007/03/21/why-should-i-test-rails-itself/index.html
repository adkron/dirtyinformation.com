I was reading Google Groups' Rails Group the other day when I ran into someone talking about why should I test the validates functions.  Here is a quote from his email:
</p><blockquote>
For example, what is the point of writing a unit test that simply
tests a validate statement in the model? Yes, it's interesting (the
first time, at least) that the test works and that, golly-gee, Rails
works as advertised, as well, but is there any real use in doing this?
<br />
I can imagine a scenario where a I update Rails and suddenly a unit
test that tests a Rails validator fails, but I expect the Rails
development team would find this before me. Or is that too naive?

I just thought I would post my response for anyone who has the same question.  Also, sorry if the format is bad or to quick, but I was trying to hurry when I wrote him the response.

Don&apos;t look it as testing Rails.  You are testing your model on testing validates.  Let&apos;s say you write this class:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_length_of :phone_number, :within =&gt; 7..10
  ...
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So you write a test:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
def test_phone_number_length_incorrect
  person = Person.new(:phone_number =&gt; &apos;123456&apos;)
  person.valid?
  assert person.errors.invalid?(:phone_number), &apos;Invalid Phone Number Coming Back as Valid&apos;
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think we would all agree that this test makes sure that a valid phone number passes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now not thinking you do a find and replace and replace all 7s with 8s or maybe number with numbers is more likely.  So you have:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_length_of :phone_numbers, :within =&gt; 7..10
  ...
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now you can place :phone_number =&gt; &apos;12&apos; into your database because you are now validating :phone_numbers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you have a test you run tests after you completed the find and replace, and this error would be caught right away.  That is why you &apos;test Rails.&apos;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;</pre>
