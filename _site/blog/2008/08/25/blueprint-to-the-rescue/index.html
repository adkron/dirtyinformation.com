My biggest issue in web development has always been design, and keeping my css files in a state that is understandable.  I always end up with a million classes and ids that are hard to keep up.  Dealing with Internet Explorer and its "unique" way to do certain things can make everyone wish for standards.

With all this headache I've found my <a href='http://www.miralus.com/'>HeadOn</a> with <a href='http://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css/tree/master'>BlueprintCSS</a>.  With one set of classes and some forethought I can get a nice looking page that looks the same in all my browsers.  I'd go into detail, but the <a href='http://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css/tree/master/TUTORIAL.textile'>tutorial</a> is really all the jump start you need.

<a href='http://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css/tree/master'>BlueprintCSS</a> does keep me in a grid layout, but this constraint is easy to live with when I know that every browser is going to look like I expect.

If you're wishing all your browsers looked the same after a hard days work, <a href='http://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css/tree/master'>BlueprintCSS</a> might be the solution for you.
