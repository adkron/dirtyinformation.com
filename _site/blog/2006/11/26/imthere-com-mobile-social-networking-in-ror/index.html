I may be a little biased since I'm on board with <a href='http://ramped.com'>Ramped Media</a>, but if your looking for something to do, and love going out you should check out this mobile integrated site.
</p><p>
There are many features that include sending media to and from the site with your mobile phone.

Take a look because in the future you and everyone you know will be saying, "<a href='http://ImThere.com'> ImThere!</a>"
