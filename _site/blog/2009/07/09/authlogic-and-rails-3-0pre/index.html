  With some of the moving around of code in Rails 3 Authlogic is broken.  This is a quick fix, and not the solution.  Add the following to your Session class:
</p><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre&gt;
class UserSession &lt; Authlogic::Session::Base
  def self.model_name
    ActiveModel::Name.new(self.to_s)
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre><p>
You should be good to go.  I have to read up on the process for patching authlogic.  Right now it is late and I am sick.  I hope this quick fix gets someone going.
