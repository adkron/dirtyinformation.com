Doing a code review is difficult for me.  I don't always think of the design implications because I'm trying t hurry and get back to coding.  I have mainly been checking for tests, and functionality.  This needs to change and I think I've got some decent steps to help me make the leap, and use some tools to help illustrate my concerns to my coworkers.

  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://jonathanaquino.com/CodeReviews.pdf&apos;&gt;Code Review Cheat Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Great points on how to handle a code review without upsetting the developer of that code.&lt;/dd&gt;

 &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://ruby.sadi.st/Flog.html&apos;&gt;Flog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;A &apos;golf&apos; score for your code.  Anytime code hurts my eyes, flog has a score that backs up my thoughts.  Even without the developer knowing how things are being scored numbers seem to work for us.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://ruby.sadi.st/Flay.html&apos;&gt;Flay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Find violations of the dry principle and often fixing these issues can lower your flog score.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://github.com/martinjandrews/roodi/tree/master&apos;&gt;Roodi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Points out OO Design principle issues.  I haven&apos;t used this much, but the few test runs I tried came up with some good suggestions.  Really you should just check out the docs for all the things Roodi does.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://github.com/kevinrutherford/reek/tree/master&apos;&gt;Reek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Ruby code smell detector.  Reek looks for a lot of common &lt;a href=&apos;http://wiki.github.com/kevinrutherford/reek/code-smells&apos;&gt;code smells&lt;/a&gt; and is easily configureable.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre><p>
I hope that by bringing a new approach to code reviews I can improve our product, team morale, and the skills of everyone involved.  I will keep you posted on how my toolbox works out.  I'd also welcome any suggestions on source about improving code reviews and/or tools like the above that help focus where I need to spend the most time reviewing.
