I'm so tired of running into issues with inheritance.  I avoid it like the plague, but unfortunately I have to deal with it in some of the code I work with.  Tonight is the night that I lower my tolerance level for inheritance.

I used to think deep inheritance was the only issue.  Tonight I was trying to refactor a controller class, but every time I changed something  a bunch of other controllers would break.  I can handle this for a little while, but this is really starting to get annoying.  One level of inheritance still causing pain.  The final straw was when I tried to add a before filter to the to controller and all my show methods in the other controllers quit working.

Now I'm off to convince the rest of the team to lower their tolerance levels.  We all knows it's bad, but we need to stop drinking a case a day.
