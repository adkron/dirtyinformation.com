title: Why? Why? Why?
---

Are you afraid to ask, "why?" It is such a simple question. Just one
syllable and the sentence is complete. Yet I remember struggling with my
ability to ask that very question. Now I ask myself, "Why not?" Asking
is a great way to make sure you are delivering true value to your
customer.

I'd like to start like
[Freud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) and blame our
parents. If you grew up like me you weren't really allowed to utter that
word to your parents when they told you to do something. Also if you
were like me it was because I repeated the question over an over until I
had driven someone crazy. So `why` alone can bring back memories of
frustrated parents, and we don't want our customers to be frustrated
with us.

Customers are paying us to ask them, "why?" When we ask, "why," we are
taking the opportunity to truly understand what the customer
needs. The customer sees that we are trying to understand the heart of
their business. No customer is going to be upset that we are excited
and inquisitive about what they want us to accomplish. If they want
someone to sit down and not have input then they should have hired
someone else. What better way to know more about the product than to
ask lots of questions.

The answers help better direct the product and make decisions about how to
move forward. When we understand the `why` we can let the customer know
how sound of an idea we are working on. News Flash: The customer isn't
always right. It is part of our job to help them get there. It is really
hard to help fulfil their needs when we don't truly understand their
needs.

Okay, I need to ask myself now, "Why did I write this article?" Well, I'm
tried of seeing bad features in great products. I'm tired of cleaning up
after people who refused to ask that simple question. Sure, I appreciate
the client, but I'd much rather spend my time adding new features
instead of fixing the ones that were misunderstood or half-cocked ideas.

Pluses to asking "Why?"
------------------------

* a better understanding of the feature/product
* a basis on which to anticipate future direction
* knowing if this is really the "right" feature
* delighting the customer with their hiring decision
