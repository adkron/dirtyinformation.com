title: Important Partnerships

Sometimes I really love the encouragement of having my friend push me to
write posts. I think without having our pact I wouldn't ever get
anything written. Other times, like tonight I feel like it is a burden,
but I still try to get it out the door.

I've had an exhausting weekend. It has been fun, but I'm a little burnt
out. I was listening to my good friend and
co-host, [John
Sextro](http://twitter.com/johnsextro), discuss [sustainable
pace](http://www.thisagilelife.com/39/) on our latest podcast. He had
gone off to do a podcast alone and I enjoyed his message very much.

I know that John has a passion for what he does, as do I. That is what
makes it so hard to make sure you take that break. Sometimes taking a
break actually seems more exhausting than the work. That is how my weekend
worked out.

It was very busy at my house with my five kids and a
birthday party. We had twenty two people over for brunch. I enjoyed my
time with friends and family. I know that I wouldn't be where I am today
without them. The most important one is my marvelous, wonderful, amazing
wife, [Kelley](http://at-home-mommy.blogspot.com/). She is the most
important person in my life. This weekend we didn't get to spend the
time I would like together. That is why I'm signing off early.

Remember that every great team needs time to unwind together.

I love you, Kelley King.
