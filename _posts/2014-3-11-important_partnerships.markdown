title: Important Partnerships

Sometimes I really love having my friend push me to
write posts. Without our pact I would never get
anything written. Other times, like tonight, I feel like it is a burden,
but I still feel accomplished when I get a post out the door.

I've had an exhausting weekend. It has been fun, but I'm a little burned
out. I was listening to my good friend and
co-host, [John
Sextro](http://twitter.com/johnsextro), discuss [sustainable
pace](http://www.thisagilelife.com/39/) on our latest podcast. He had
recorded a solo podcast, and I found his message to be a great reminder.

I know that John has a passion for what he does, as do I. Passion
makes it hard to take a break. Often taking a
break actually seems more exhausting than the work. My weekend
away from work was a great example.

It was very busy at my house with my five kids and a
birthday party. We had twenty-two people over for brunch. I enjoyed my
time with friends and family, and I know that I wouldn't be where I am today
without their support. My most important support comes from my marvelous, wonderful, amazing
wife, [Kelley](http://at-home-mommy.blogspot.com/). She is the most
important person in my life. This weekend we didn't get to spend the
time I would like together. That is why I'm signing off early.

Remember that every great team needs time to unwind together.

I love you, Kelley King.
