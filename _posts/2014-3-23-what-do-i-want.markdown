title: What Do I Want
---

I've got my hands in a lot of things. I run my own business. I am the
organizer of two Ruby groups. I record a weekly
[podcast](http://thisagilelife.com). I write a blog post every week. I
am a husband, a parent, and a foster parent. That is a huge amount of
_I_s to go around. Sometimes I wonder how I keep going.

All of this business has me thinking about why I do all of these things.
What do I want? What drives me? I can say that I don't feel short on
passion for any of my activities. I'm going to focus on my
business/programming as part of this blog.

I love what I do. I get to take nothing and make it into something;
just to delight other people. Why wouldn't you want to do that? I
couldn't imagine myself with a different job. Writing software with
great design is my passion. Is passion enough to sustain me in the long
run? What do I want out of my career?

In the short term I want to keep moving forward and creating great
products. I want to delight my customers and leave them in a better
position than I found them. I want them to have the freedom to hire
anyone in the world, but come to me because they know I care.

Leaning is a very important part of the satisfaction I get from my
career. I want to make sure that I am sharing what I learn with those
around me. This is part of the reason I am on the podcast. I want to
share myself with the world. I don't want others to make the same
mistakes that I have made. Although this sounds altruistic that is a
lie. This is the most selfish part of all my activities. I love to teach
because I learn more in teaching than any other endeavor. The questions
I'm asked and the situations that others seem to share with me in
hopes that I have the answer.

In the middle term I want to build a small team that can get companies
off with a great product. I don't want contracts that I drag on forever.
Long contracts are great when the customer needs me, but I don't want to
drag on contracts to bleed them dry. I've seen too many situations like
this and it creates a fire burning anger. The defenestration of all
company leaders that have that goal would make our career field more
trusted and the world a better place. When I take a client I want to
become their biggest fan.

I want to make great products and even have my team help the customer's
team get started. I've been on long term projects and they are
fantastic, but I really love helping people get to their vision with a
sustainable piece of software. Too many startups end up with loads of
tech debt by the time their product hits the market. This tech debt then
slows them down so the competition can arise and over take them. I love
showing companies how to [live like no one else, so that they can live
like no one else](http://www.daveramsey.com/home/).

Long term I would love to have my own products that help the world. This
is not the ultimate goal or anything. I would like to have some small
products that make a sustainable amount of money so that I can
worry less about the income and concentrate on all the previous goals. I
want to continue to teach, learn, and hopefully inspire others. I want
to continue to help customers reach their goals by focusing their vision
and building amazing tools and products with them.

What do you want from your career and other activities? Whatever it
may be, make sure that you are having fun and making the world a better
place.
