title: An Agile Contract
---

In starting my own business people always ask how I write contracts that
don't have a fixed price or a well defined scope. I'd love to talk about
my wizardry of speaking or how amazing I am with my words, but you've
read my blog. I only tell the truth as I know it and am confident in
what I say. So there is no big secret to leaving our scope and getting
contracts that aren't based on a fixed bid. It isn't your place to set
their budget, and fixed bid contracts rarely leave either side happy. So
I thought I would share this contract with you, or at least a portion of
it. This is actually an amendment to a contract that changed from a
feasibility study into a full blown project.

>The purpose of this amendment is to create a working agreement that is
beneficial to both sides and allows the delivery of the best product to
fit the needs of THE COMPANY.

>Working Agreement
>The CONSULTANT will provide software development services and expertise
to THE COMPANY under the direction of X with a backup decision
maker of Y. The CONSULTANT will work hand in hand with X
in order to provide the most value to the product.

>After each unit of work the CONSULTANT will demo and deliver all
software that has been completed to that point. After the demo there
will be a small planning meeting in which all interested parties are
able to attend. The purpose of the planning meeting is to further refine
the requirements and set the next priorities. At each demo THE COMPANY and the
CONSULTANT will have the option to continue working together in order to
further development or to take delivery of the product as is. At each
milestone THE COMPANY is free to use the software as long as they are engaged
with the contractor and all payments have been made on time. Upon final
payment THE COMPANY will be given all source code produced by the CONSULTANT.

If you have any comments on the wording please don't hesitate to shoot
me an email. I am not a lawyer and am not giving legal advice. I am
merely trying to say that if you don't try to give them a non-fixed bid
contract then of course it is hard to do. Most people understand when
you explain to them the life cycle of software and our changing world.
The most important part is to be honest with yourself and your customer.
