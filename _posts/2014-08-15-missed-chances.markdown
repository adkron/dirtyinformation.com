title: Missed Chances
---

I have been spending a month and a half looking for new clients. It has
been very hard on my psyche. I make calls and send emails all day. I
saved many months of money so that I would not have to worry. I'm in no
way in danger of running out any time soon, but I'm still having a hard
time getting my head into the situation I am in.

The progress of sales can be very hard to measure. Conversations can
seem to speed very quickly and then grind to a hault. Therefor it is
extreamly difficult for me to feel accomplished until a sale is complete.
What can we do make sales go faster?

I don't know the answer to that question, but I do have some ideas on
when to concentrate on sales. Always! At the beginning of building my
company I was constantly talking to potential customers, and marketing
my services. I spent months telling customers that I had no current
availablity. I began to feel bad for always saying no. I thought it
would hurt my chances of working with these potential customers in the
future. I stopped advertising and marketing.

Stopping my marketing was the worst thing that could have happenned to my
pipeline. When I finished two contracts at once I was left out in the
cold with no work. I had to start over at building new relationships.
Many of the old relationships are still there, but they are not as
strong as they once were. My contacts were not constantly hearing my
name and thinking about my services. Now those contacts are just
remembering what I have to offer.

Now I need to find ways to keep my name and services on their minds.
Right now I'm going to spend some time looking into email marketing. I
need something that won't take as much time as handshaking and making
phone calls. The more time consuming the marketing the less time I have
to get to the work I enjoy. If you have any ideas I would love to hear
them.
