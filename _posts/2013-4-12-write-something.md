title: Write Something
---

Ok so here I go. I don't write often bucase inspiration comes at the
most inopportune times. I always want to write something when I'm in the
car or worse the bathroom. I thought I would force myself today. This is
for two people. [One](http://twitter.com/jcsextro) I've known for a long
time and record a [podcast](http://thisagilelife.com) with. The
[other](http://twitter.com/_zph) I just met, but we have a
[ razor ]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_razor ) and a love of
[ Ruby ]( http://www.ruby-lang.org/ ) in common. I told one of them I would
give a [ pomodoro ]( http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/ ) a go.

You see, recently I attended [ the best damn ruby
conference ]( https://rubymidwest.com ) anywhere. During that conference
speaker [ @wikimatze ]( http://twitter.com/wikimatze ) talked about giving
back to [ OSS ]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software ) by
doing one pomodoro every day. That got me thinking about all kinds of
things to use pomodor's for.

Lately my back has been killing me, and I sit in a chair focused for
hours. I thought about calling
[ Lisa Nowak ]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Nowak ) for some advice on
how to hang in there for the long haul. Then I decided to apply the
pomodoro to my back problem. I work for the 20 minutes and then go for a
walk during the 5 minute breaks. Not only does this help strengthen my
back, but I don't have to wear diapers. I also spend that time thinking
about the next step. I really think it has helped me focus and gives my
mind a time to make sure I'm on the right path. Sometimes it is hard to
notice how dark the road is unless you look up.

Then I thought about this blog. Anyone who has ever read this blog in
the past will know how ugly it was. Ok, so it is still ugly if you are
reading this in a timely manner (or maybe even if you are reading this a
year from now). It is a vast improvement, trust me. I'd like to include
a screen shot, but I'm too lazy and with priorities this article really
isn't worth an extra pomodoro. So I spent a few pomodors on the look and
feel of this horrible site.

I then spent a pomodoro setting up a new Ruby user group. I am now
organizing two groups, [ PJ ]( http://twitter.com/aspleenic ) would be proud
or think I'm crazy. You see I organize
[ STLRuby ]( http://meetup.org/stlruby ) because I've worked 108 miles from
my home for 6.5 years. Recently I started working remotely for
[ The Able Few ]( http://theablefew.com ). This puts me closer to home and
has allowed me to start [ Rolla Ruby ]( http://meetup.org/Rolla-Ruby ). I'm
so excited to be able to get this going. I've wanted this for a while, but
haven't had the time with all the driving. There is a
[ university ]( http://mst.edu ) in Rolla, not where I live but close, that
I went to for my CS Degree. It had a much better name when I went there. I
want to reach out to the CS students there and get them into testing before
they hit the real world and have to be taught there. Maybe one of them will
speak at a future [ Ruby Midwest ]( http://rubymidwest.com )

Well, my time is up. Sorry the muse didn't find me today, but I'll be
back I can promise you another pomodor of that.
