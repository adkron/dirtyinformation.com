title: Legacy Woes

<p>
I've been working with a legacy database for a while, and I'm getting tired of writing methods to do all of the nice hooks that ActiveRecord comes with.  Hooks like automatically setting  created_at on a save.  I did what any self respecting lazy programmer would do, and created a new gem, <a href="http://github.com/adkron/legacy_woes">LegacyWoes</a>.  If you fix some legacy issues I'd love to talk or take a patch.
