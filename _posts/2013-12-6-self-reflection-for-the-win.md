title: Self Reflection for the Win
---

If we aren't busy getting better then we should retire. It is a bold
statement, but I believe it. I don't want to work with people who aren't
trying to move their knowledge forward. With that in mind many people
don't know how to learn and move forward.

Recently I started using note cards as suggested by
[Zach Briggs](http://theotherzach.com) this is a fantastic technique, but
is recent and doesn't solve the self reflection on what we need to learn.
It also works best with short answers and "how to" tasks. There is a bit
of self reflection that is missing.

In order to self reflect I've been keeping a "programming" journal for a
few years. The journal is where I put all of my thoughts on programming,
agile, teams, and myself. It has been fantastic, and you should keep one
yourself.

Programming is why I started this journal, but is probably where the
least amount of its notes come. Writing down idioms and patterns that I
notice have been really helpful to reflect on later. The journal is not
lined and these scrawled comments usually appear more as a mind map with
little things jotted all around them. Actually this is true of
everything I write in the journal. Many things that I learn and reflect
on turn into blog posts, tweets, or even [podcast
episodes](http://thisagilelife.com).

People are a very important part of any working agile team and my
journal gets pummeled with plenty of notes about people too. I rarely
write in the journal about a specific person. The people notes lean more
towards people patterns. This is where (A Great Cast of
Characters)[/blog/2012/03/06/building-a-great-team/] came from. Some of
the most important aspects of my career have come out of these notes.
Do NOT forget to write about people and leadership in your journal.

Blog post ideas also get jotted down in the journal. Maybe I should
actually put the time into completing these posts. Ok, so this is one of
the posts, look it is working. I have a lot more of these that some day
might actually show up here. These ideas start out as a few words on a
page and notes get built around them over time. I will go back to pages
with single words or "titles" of blog posts and add ideas as they pop
up while working. Keep these thoughts light and fill them in as you are
"inspired." Again this is a [mind
map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) for the future post.

The biggest part of this journal was the starting of the three
questions.

Questions
---------

* What defines success for me/the team/the product/the company today?
* What did I do today to drive towards that success?
* What did I do today that detracted from that success?

This miniature retro changed my life. Just the act of thinking about
these questions and writing down the answers changes the way I make
decisions and the way I behave the next day. It is also interesting to
go back and read these later.

Please, do us all a favor and keep improving who you are. We already
like you, but we are all growing around you. If you aren't doing the
same you will get left behind.
