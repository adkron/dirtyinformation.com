title: Let Me Test Your Rails/Ruby App
---
<p>
I'm going to be doing some writing for a few magazines and I would like to write tests for you.  If you have a part of your app that is particularly hard to test and you would like some help, send me the whole app or just the parts that are pertinent.
</p>
<p>
I know what you might be thinking, "Who does this guy think he is?"  I'm a full time Rails developer on an application that must support Oracle and MySql.  I also must interact with a Java side and a ten year old database. Here is the read out from 'rake stats' and 'time rake test.'
