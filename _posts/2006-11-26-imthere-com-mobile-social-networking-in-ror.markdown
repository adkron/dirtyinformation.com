I may be a little biased since I'm on board with <a href="http://ramped.com">Ramped Media</a>, but if your looking for something to do, and love going out you should check out this mobile integrated site.
</p>
<p>
There are many features that include sending media to and from the site with your mobile phone.

<p>
Take a look because in the future you and everyone you know will be saying, "<a href="http://ImThere.com"> ImThere!</a>"
