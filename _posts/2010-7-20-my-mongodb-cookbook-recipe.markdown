title: My MongoDB Cookbook Recipe
---

I've been doing some playing with [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) lately. I've grown very fond of the platform, and am looking forward to using it in some of my
future projects.  My first gift back to the community is a cookbook [recipe](http://cookbook.mongodb.org/patterns/finding_max_and_min/). I'm hoping that soon I
will be able to give some code contributions.
