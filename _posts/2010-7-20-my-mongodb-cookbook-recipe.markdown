title: My MongoDB Cookbook Recipe
---
<p>
  I've been doing some playing with <a href='http://mongodb.org'>MongoDB</a> lately. I've grown very fond of the platform, and am looking forward to using it in some of my future projects.  My first gift back to the community is a cookbook <a href="http://cookbook.mongodb.org/patterns/finding_max_and_min/">recipe</a>. I'm hoping that soon I will be able to give some code contributions.
